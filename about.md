I am a data scientist, developer, public health geek, and lover/skeptic of tech.

Went to [Oberlin College](https://home.oberlin.edu/) to study biology and dance,
then to [Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/)
to learn about sociomedical science and public health informatics. Now at
[Pegged Software](http://www.peggedsoftware.com/), the Data Science team, where
we match hospitals with healthcare workers who best fit the job.

I like to ask questions of the world and build data pipelines that try to get
at those questions in some meaningful way.
