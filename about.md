I am a machine learning engineer, AI geek, and lover/skeptic of tech.

Went to [Oberlin College](https://home.oberlin.edu/){:target="_blank"} to study
biology and dance, then to
[Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"}
to learn about sociomedical science and public health informatics. Now at
[Talkspace](https://www.talkspace.com/){:target="_blank"} in the Data
Science team, where we make therapy more accessible and affordable.

I like to ask questions of the world, build data pipelines, and implement
machine learning systems that try to get at those questions in some meaningful
way.
